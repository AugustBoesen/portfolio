              <p className='text-left pt-2'>My main instrument is the piano with 10+ years of practice.
              Alongside that, I also have experience playing drums, violin, tenor sax and electric bass.
              I currently play as a keyboardist/percussionist in a few bands, including the showband "Lyydiset".</p>
              <p className='text-left pt-2'>I have studied composing and have worked on countless compositions and arrangements over the years.
              I've done theatrical, commercial, freelance and fixed productions with 100+ tracks played publicly.
              I've also worked on sheetwriting and have worked on sheets for up to full-scale orchestras and professional choirs.</p>

              <h2 className='text-3xl mt-2'>Production & Design</h2>
              <p className='text-left pt-2'>I have practiced music production since 2013, first with Logic Pro X and later Ableton permanently.
              I specialize in virtual instrumentation / engineering and electronic sound design.
              My primary focus is consistently creating organic, living soundscapes with both instruments and artificial sound alike.</p>
              <p className='text-left pt-2'>For a long time, I focused on doing game soundtracks, but slowly shifted towards alternatives.
              I have experience mixing studio recordings and live recordings on-set and as post-production.
              Furthermore, I have worked in several productions as a producer for ambient soundscapes, with a focus on horror-themed ambience.</p>
