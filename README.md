This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Running the project

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## About file structure
All content generally resides in the "src" folder.
1. "app" folder contains the layout and the home page.
2. "components" folder contains dynamic content and everything in the home page, demonstrating component usage in building websites.
3. "img" folder is self explanatory, containing images used.
4. "pages" folder contains the other 3 pages and a "_app.tsx" for multi-page metadata.
5. "styles" folder contains globals.css and possible additional css files.
The project uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for demonstrative purposes, utilizing the framework for faster workflow outcomes.
